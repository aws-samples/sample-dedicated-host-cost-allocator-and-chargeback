# AWS Dedicated Host Cost Allocator

A Python tool that automatically allocates AWS Dedicated Host costs to individual EC2 instances based on resource consumption and custom tags, enabling accurate chargeback and cost attribution across teams and departments.

Disclaimer: This is sample code and user must do their own due-diligence before actual usage.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup (30 seconds)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure AWS credentials (30 seconds)
aws configure

# 3. Run it (1 minute)
# Single account
python cost_allocator.py --method weighted

# Multi-account (requires setup - see Multi-Account Organizations section below)
cp config-multi-account.yaml config.yaml  # Edit with your accounts
python cost_allocator_multi_account.py --method weighted

# Done! Check the generated CSV file
```

### üîÑ For Regular Reports
**Set up automated execution:**

```bash
# Cron job for monthly execution
0 9 1 * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/cost_allocator.py --method weighted

# Or use AWS Systems Manager for EC2-based scheduling
```

### üè¢ Multi-Account Organizations
**For organizations with multiple AWS accounts:**

1. **Create trust policy** (save as `trust-policy.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<MANAGEMENT-ACCOUNT-ID>:root"},
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
     }]
   }
   ```

2. **Create IAM roles** in each member account:
   ```bash
   # Create the role with trust policy
   aws iam create-role --role-name CostAllocatorRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
   
   # Attach the cost allocator policy (create this first using the IAM policy template above)
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name CostAllocatorRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-ID>:policy/DedicatedHostCostAllocatorReadOnly
   ```
  Follow IAM best practices: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html

3. **Configure accounts** in `config-multi-account.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   accounts:
     - id: "<ACCOUNT-ID-1>"
       name: "production"
       role: "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-ID-1>:role/CostAllocatorRole"
       regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"]  # Multiple regions
     - id: "<ACCOUNT-ID-2>"
       name: "development"
       role: "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-ID-2>:role/CostAllocatorRole"
       regions: ["us-east-1"]  # Single region
   ```
   
   **Region Configuration:**
   - **Single region**: `regions: ["us-east-1"]`
   - **Multiple regions**: `regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"]`
   - **All regions**: Add all regions where you have dedicated hosts

4. **Run multi-account script**:
   ```bash
   python cost_allocator_multi_account.py --method weighted
   ```

    name: "production"
    role: "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-ID-1>:role/CostAllocatorRole"
    regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]  # Production in multiple US regions
  - id: "<ACCOUNT-ID-2>"
    name: "europe-prod"
    role: "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-ID-2>:role/CostAllocatorRole"
    regions: ["eu-west-1", "eu-central-1"]  # Europe account
```

## üîß Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Default weighted allocation
python cost_allocator.py

# Equal split allocation
python cost_allocator.py --method equal

# Specific regions
python cost_allocator.py --regions us-east-1,eu-west-1

# Custom time period
python cost_allocator.py --days-back 60
```

```

## üßÆ Allocation Methods

### Weighted Allocation (Recommended)
Distributes costs based on vCPU consumption:
- `c5.large` (2 vCPUs) gets 2/30 of total cost
- `c5.4xlarge` (16 vCPUs) gets 16/30 of total cost

### Equal Split Allocation
Divides costs equally among all instances regardless of size.

## ‚è∞ AWS Cost Data Timing

AWS Cost Explorer data has a 24-48 hour delay. For immediate testing, use cost data from 2-3 days ago.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### No Cost Data Found
- Ensure dedicated hosts have been running for 24-48+ hours
- Verify AWS Cost Explorer permissions
- Check that regions match where hosts are located

### Permission Errors
Ensure your AWS credentials have the required permissions:

**Required AWS Permissions:**
- `ec2:DescribeHosts` - Read dedicated host information
- `ec2:DescribeInstances` - Read EC2 instance details
- `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes` - Get instance specifications
- `ce:GetCostAndUsage` - Access cost data from Cost Explorer

**IAM Policy Template:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeHosts",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes"
            ],
            "Resource": "<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EC2_RESOURCE_ARNS or what your organisation allows>"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ce:GetCostAndUsage"
            ],
            "Resource": "<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_COST_EXPLORER_RESOURCE_ARNS or what your organisation allows>"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Resource ARN Examples:**
- EC2 Resources: `arn:aws:ec2:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT-ID>:instance/*` or `arn:aws:ec2:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT-ID>:dedicated-host/*`
- Cost Explorer: `arn:aws:ce:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT-ID>:<RESOURCE>`
- For account-wide access (if required): `arn:aws:ec2:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT-ID>:<RESOURCE>`

**Placeholder Definitions:**
- `<REGION>`: AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`) 
- `<ACCOUNT-ID>`: Your 12-digit AWS account ID
- `<RESOURCE>`: Specific resource type or `*` for all resources

**Security Best Practices:**
- Replace placeholders with most restrictive ARNs possible for your use case
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
- Add condition statements for IP or time-based restrictions
- Regularly audit and rotate access keys
- Consider using AWS SSO/IAM Identity Center for enhanced security

**Create the policy:**
```bash
# Save customized JSON as dedicated-host-policy.json, then:
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name DedicatedHostCostAllocatorReadOnly \
  --policy-document file://dedicated-host-policy.json
```

### No Dedicated Hosts Found
- Verify you have dedicated hosts in the specified regions
- Check that hosts are in 'available' state
- Ensure instances are running with 'host' tenancy

## üîí Security

This tool follows AWS security best practices:

- **Read-Only Operations**: Only reads AWS data, never modifies infrastructure
- **Least Privilege**: Requires minimal IAM permissions (EC2 describe, Cost Explorer read)
- **No Data Storage**: Processes data in memory, only outputs local CSV files
- **Credential Safety**: Never logs or stores AWS credentials
- **Multi-Account**: Uses cross-account roles with proper trust policies

**Security Considerations:**
- Review the required IAM permissions before deployment
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
- Regularly rotate access keys if using programmatic access
- Consider using AWS SSO/IAM Identity Center for enhanced security

## üí∞ Cost

This tool is designed to be cost-effective:

- **No Infrastructure**: Runs locally or on existing compute resources
- **API Calls Only**: Only incurs standard AWS API call charges
- **Minimal Usage**: Typical monthly execution costs under $1 for most organizations
- **Cost Breakdown**:
  - EC2 API calls: ~$0.01 per 1000 calls
  - Cost Explorer API: ~$0.01 per request
  - Estimated monthly cost: $0.10 - $1.00 depending on account size

**Cost Optimization:**
- Run monthly instead of daily to minimize API calls
- Use specific regions to reduce discovery overhead
- Consider caching results for frequent analysis
